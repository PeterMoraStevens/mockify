# mockify
An open-source mock interview platform with the goal of hosting for free.

This project is built around the issue I have with hosting mock interviews. It usually takes too long to coordinate with the other person on what platform to do our coding on; each person wants a different place. Some people want to call on FaceTime, others want to use Discord. By creating this website, I'm able to centralize all these decisions into one location.
